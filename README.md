# PauseDropboxOnBattery
Pause Dropbox when on battery power. Just run the app, and it will check every five seconds if running on battery power. If running on battery power, it will suspend the Dropbox application, and if not, it will unsuspend it.

*Note:* since it is suspending Dropbox (and not just pausing the sync), Dropbox will be unresponsive. This means that any Dropbox-related windows must be closed, otherwise they won't be able to be closed.
